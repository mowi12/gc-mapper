# GC Mapper

## Idea

The idea behind GC Mapper is the following:
If you have one or more unknown values in your coordinates GC Mapper will draw every possible combination on a map, making it very easy to rule out certain values.

## Development

Currently this repository only contains a proof of concept if this idea works.
In the future this will either be transformed into a fancy webpage or included in a collection of tools.
